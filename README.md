[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/hamsham/light_io.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/hamsham/light_io)


## About light_io
This project provides basic utilities for accessing the file system, creating,
removing, and moving files on different operating systems. While portable, it
uses some C11-based functions and operations but should otherwise be portable
across Windows and *Nix-based operating systems.



## Samples
Sample application can be found within the "test" directory.



## TODO
- [ ] Create functions for moving files and folders.
